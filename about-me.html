  		<h1> Hi Everyone !</h1>
  		<p>   My name is Robin Kitlinski and I am young, creative and open - minded person. When I was younger I used to draw and design things in Paint. I was learning how to use different tools and what they actually do. After my high school I went to Technical School where I was learning IT. I gained there an IT technician degree plus did some projects during that time with few qualifications too, like: CISCO, Web Development Course and Coastal Skipper Qualification ( I started sailing when I was 13 and few years later I received a qualification). After my technical school in Poland I decided to move out to Aberdeen. It was a big move for me, but I really wanted to change my environment and so on. I started studying at North East Scotland College Interactive Media (Web Development) Course. I finished first year where we went through some very interesting projects during the course. Like making banners, mobile applications UI, logos, building websites - even for the real clients - Nescol Film Festival Website. I did learn a lot during that year and I would love to gain more knowledge in coding, designing & experience as well ! I believe that everything in life happens for a reason ;-) If you get to this point you probably just realised that you are interested what was my story ! And it is more than that what I just wrote here, but... </p>
      </br>
      <p> Do you wanna know more about myself ?</p></br>
      <p> Please contact me via: email or phone ! ;-)</p>
